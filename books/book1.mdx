# Welcome to My Blog!

This is my first blog post using MDX. MDX allows me to write **Markdown** with embedded React components, which is pretty awesome!

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you seamlessly write JSX in your Markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

Here's some code:

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```

## Features I Love

- **Easy to write**: Just like Markdown
- **Component support**: Can use React components
- **Syntax highlighting**: Code blocks look great
- **Flexible**: Perfect for technical writing

You can even use custom components like badges: <Badge>cool</Badge>

## What's Next?

I'm planning to write about:

1. My experience with Rust
2. TypeScript tips and tricks
3. Building better developer tools

> This is a quote block. It looks pretty nice!

That's all for now. Thanks for reading!
