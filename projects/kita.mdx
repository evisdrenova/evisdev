Kita is a desktop application that is meant to replace the default Mac spotlight application.

I wrote Kita using the Tauri desktop app framework which is a Rust backend with a React/Typescript front-end.

Then for certain system level APIs on the Mac, I used Rust's FFI and bridging to directly call Swift functions.

Kita shows the users all fo the applications and files they have installed and then performs semantic search to find relevant files.

It has also has support for fully local AI using the llama.cpp library which instantiates a server and loads .gguf model.

I decided to use Mistral 7B quantized as my model. It's not terribly slow and reasonably smart.
