[mirror](https://github.com/evisdrenova/mirror) is an AI-powered knowledge management tool designed to clip, save and automatically organize any text, URL or image.

I constantly have 4-6 browser windows with 30-40 tabs open in each one and I can never find anything. I use my tabs are bookmarks which is a terrible way to organize things but it's the easiest way I've found to keep track of things that I'm working on and things that I want to read/explore.

So I set out to build a better system to organize things without cluttering my browser tabs. Enter Mirror.

Mirror is designed around a global shortcut system that allows you to highlight any text and hit a global shortcut such as Command+Shift+S to save what you highlighted.

Once you hit the global shortcut, the clip (as I call it) is sent to an LLM for categorization and tagging, then saved in a local sqlite db.

This is then surfaced in a desktop app that shows you everything you saved and allows you to search across all of the items.

It would be like searching across all of your tabs in all browser windows and all of the content of those tabs to find the thing that you're looking for.

The backend is written in Rust and the front end in Tauri and it's completely open source.

I love using it and hope others do too!
