[Neosync](https://github.com/nucleuscloud/neosync) is an open source distributed data streaming platform that is used to anonymize and stream data across environments.

Hundreds of companies used Neosync to anonymize sensitive production data and stream it across environments to stage, dev and even local databases.

I co-founded Neosync and ran it for 3 years. In the early days I wrote code full time before shifting my focus to sales, marketing, hiring and customer service as we started to scale.

We supported all major databases - Postgres, Mysql, MS Sql, MongoDB and DynamoDB and processed billions of records through our platform monthly.

Technically, one of our major innovations was maintaining referential integrity across databases that had thousands of tables.

We did this by resolving the relationships in a database and then handling those references as we anonymized and subsetted data.

It was a great time and I learned a lot about myself, entrepreneurship and how to start and run a startup.
