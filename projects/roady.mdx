[roady](https://github.com/evisdrenova/roady) is public roadmap tool built ontop of Linear.

I built Roady because we needed a public roadmap for Neosync but didn't want to pay for one.

It sits ontop of Linear and renders roadmap that public uses can view, vote on, comment and request features on.

All of the data gets synced back to Linear for product and engineering teams to review and manage.
