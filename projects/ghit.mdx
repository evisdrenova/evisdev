[ghit](https://github.com/evisdrenova/ghit) is an AI-powered CLI that automates your git workflows.

For example, I mainly use ghit to automatically stage my code changes, analyze the diff, create a commit using AI and then push the changes to my remote branch.

I can do all of this using a single command `ghit` that will run this entire workflow for me.

It also supports workflows for staging individual files, just creating the commit message and others too. My goal was to automate my most common git workflows using AI so that I can execute one command instead of give.

I wrote ghit in rust using the `clap` crate which serves as a sort of harness for the CLI.

It's split up into a few modules:

- \*_llm_ - this module manages the llm interaction and constructs the requests and returns the responses
- **git** - this module handles the git workflows and commands such as getting the getting the diff, staging files, pushing to the remote branch and more
- **config** - this module manages loading the configuration file

Overall, a fun little project to make my life easier and faster.
