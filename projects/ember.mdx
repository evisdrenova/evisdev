[ember](https://github.com/evisdrenova/ember) is an AI home assistant that is designed to replace a Google Home Mini or Amazon Alexa.

Ember uses an OrangePi zero4 PCB as an edge device to to run a SST (speech to text) and TTS (text to speech) model to communicate with a user.

I configured ember to listen for a wake word (like 'hey siri') and then take in a user prompt, process it and then process the text through a speech to text model.

The backend is a typescript server which uses grpc to recieve the translated text from the edge device, call an LLM to get an answer the query and then stream the response back.

The ultimate goal is to have ember be a custom home assistant that can help me manage my day to day and really be an ambient agent (see ambient agent blogpost) for me.

Ember is still in development.
