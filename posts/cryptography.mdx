We use encryption all of the time and, as developers, libraries make it easy to implement. In fact, most of the time we don't even have to do anything, it's just invisibly already implemented in background. But that's not really satisfying for me. I like to know how things work - usually at a very granular level.

I've been to a few crytography meetups and have watched a few talks and it's always amazed me how the math _just_ works. I think most developers understand _how_ encryption works but I think very few developers understand _why_ it works. And even fewer understand the math that makes it work.

Cryptography is a broad field that includes many different types of encryption schemes. In this post, weâ€™ll focus on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), specifically within the context of Asymmetric Encryption and the math that makes it work.

Let's dive in.

# Asymmetric Encryption 101

Just to make sure that we're on the same page, let's do a quick primer on asymmetric encryption.

Asymmetric encryption, or sometimes called Public Key Encryption, uses a pair of keys - a public key and a private key, to securely encrypt and decrypt data.

What makes it powerful is that the keys are mathematically linked. So you can share the public key with anyone in the world (hence:"public") and they can use it to encrypt a message that only the private key can decrypt.

Many protocols such as TLS, SSH, Signal, WireGuard and others use asymmetric encyryption for authentication/key exchange before switching to symmetric encryption for data encryption. This hybrid approach is pretty common.

Elliptic curve cryptography (which we'll get to in a second, I promise!), is just one way of doing asymmetric encryption. There are other ways such as RSA, Kyber, and Finite-field Diffie-Hellman but ECC is quickly becoming the standard.

Okay, great, now onto the fun stuff.

# What is an Elliptic Curve?

An elliptic curve is a mathematical curve that is typically defined by a cubic equation such as:

$y^{2}=x^{3}+ax+b$

In elliptic curve crytography, we work with elliptic curves which are **nonsingular** cubic curves with a point at infinity over a finite field . These non-singular cubic curves have a few pretty cool characteristics that make them very useful in crytography:

1. The curve never intersects with itself
2. The point at infinity acts like a zero and it allows us to add points on the curve together
3. Every point on the curve has an inverse
4. If points $P$, $Q$ are on the curve then $P + Q$ is on the curve as well. This enables scalar multiplication of points and ensures that we never leave the curve.
5. The curve must be **Associative** such that $(P+Q)+R = P+(Q+R)$. This lets us sum points without worrying about paranthesis and the order of the points.
6. The curve must support **Commutativity** meaning that $P+Q = Q+P$. This just makes the math easier.

We'll see why these features are critical for ECC to work is just a bit.

One last thing, I mentioned above that we work with elliptic curves over a finite field. What does this mean?

It means that the elliptic curves that we work with in practice look less like the image above and more like this:

This is a view of the elliptic curve $y^2 \equiv x^3 - x + 1$ but over $\mathbb{F}_{23}$. You can actually see that every point in the curve has an inverse in the graph if you were to draw a line at about 11 like so.

I think this is probably deep enough into elliptic curves for this blog but if you're interested in reading more about elliptic curves, [this is free book.](http://tomlr.free.fr/Math%E9matiques/Math%20Complete/Cryptography/Guide%20to%20Elliptic%20Curve%20Cryptography%20-%20D.%20Hankerson,%20A.%20Menezes,%20S.%20Vanstone.pdf)
