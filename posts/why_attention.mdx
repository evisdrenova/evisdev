This is the third installment in my "From ... to Meaning" series. We've covered how [matrix multiplication](/why_matmul) and [activation functions](/why_activations) matrix multiplication transforms vectors and how activation functions introduce nonlinearity. Now we'll explore **attention**, the mechanism that gives LLMs their ability to understand context and relationships between words.

Attention is interesting because, in my opinion, it's the easiest mechanism to grasp conceptually but the hardest to grasp technically. But I think it's critical to understand it in order to truly grok how LLMs create meaningful responses.

Like always, let's start at the beginning and build up to the intuition.

## The Context Problem

Everything we've discussed so far has a fundamental limitation: **each word has a fixed vector**.

Consider the word "bank":

- "I sat by the river **bank**" (shore)
- "I deposited money at the **bank**" (financial institution)
- "The plane started to **bank** left" (to tilt)

How can one vector `[0.23, -0.45, 0.87, ...]` capture all three meanings? **It can't.**

Here's another example:

> "The animal didn't cross the street because **it** was too tired."

What does "it" refer to? The animal.

> "The animal didn't cross the street because **it** was too wide."

Now "it" refers to the street. Same word, completely different meaning based on context.

**This is the fundamental challenge that attention solves**: creating dynamic, context-dependent representations through matrix multiplication.

## Attention: The Core Idea

Attention does exactly this using three learned weight matrices.

At its core, attention asks a simple question:

> “Given this word, which other words in the sentence should I pay attention to?”

When you read "The cat sat on the mat because it was soft," your brain automatically:

1. **Searches** through previous words (cat? mat?)
2. **Scores** which ones are relevant (mat is more relevant for "soft")
3. **Combines** those relevant words to understand "it" means "mat"

---

## The Three Projections: Query, Key, Value

Every attention mechanism uses three weight matrices that project each word embedding into three different spaces:

$$Q = X \cdot W_Q \quad \text{(Query: "What am I looking for?")}$$
$$K = X \cdot W_K \quad \text{(Key: "What do I contain?")}$$
$$V = X \cdot W_V \quad \text{(Value: "What do I contribute?")}$$

Think of it like a database:

- **Query**: Your search terms
- **Key**: The index/tags on each entry
- **Value**: The actual content you retrieve

### Diagram 1: Three Projections

```
Input Embedding (X)
       |
       |---- matmul → W_Q → Query (Q)
       |
       |---- matmul → W_K → Key (K)
       |
       └---- matmul → W_V → Value (V)
```

## Step-by-Step: How Attention Works

Let's walk through a concrete example with the sentence: "cat sat mat"

Each word starts with an embedding vector (simplified to 4D):

```
cat = [1.0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.1]
sat = [0.3, 1.0, 0.2, 0.4]
mat = [0.8, 0.1, 0.9, 0.2]
```

### Step 1: Create Q, K, V for Each Word

We multiply each embedding by the three weight matrices:

$$Q_{\text{cat}} = \text{cat} \cdot W_Q$$
$$K_{\text{cat}} = \text{cat} \cdot W_K$$
$$V_{\text{cat}} = \text{cat} \cdot W_V$$

(Same for "sat" and "mat")

### Step 2: Calculate Attention Scores

For each word, we compute: **"How much should I pay attention to every other word?"**

Let's focus on "mat". Its query $Q_{\text{mat}}$ is compared against all keys using dot products:

$$\text{score}_{\text{mat},\text{cat}} = Q_{\text{mat}} \cdot K_{\text{cat}}^T$$
$$\text{score}_{\text{mat},\text{sat}} = Q_{\text{mat}} \cdot K_{\text{sat}}^T$$
$$\text{score}_{\text{mat},\text{mat}} = Q_{\text{mat}} \cdot K_{\text{mat}}^T$$

High dot product = high similarity = high relevance.

Then we apply **softmax** to turn scores into probabilities:

$$\text{attention}_{\text{mat}} = \text{softmax}([\text{scores}])$$

Result might be: `[0.1, 0.2, 0.7]` meaning:

- 10% attention to "cat"
- 20% attention to "sat"
- 70% attention to "mat" (itself)

### Step 3: Weighted Sum of Values

Now we create a new representation as a weighted combination:

$$\text{output}_{\text{mat}} = 0.1 \cdot V_{\text{cat}} + 0.2 \cdot V_{\text{sat}} + 0.7 \cdot V_{\text{mat}}$$

**This is the same weighted sum concept from our matrix multiplication blog!** We're taking a linear combination of value vectors, weighted by relevance.

### Diagram 2: Attention Flow for One Word

```
Query (mat)
    |
    | dot product with all Keys
    ↓
[score_cat, score_sat, score_mat]
    |
    | softmax
    ↓
[0.1, 0.2, 0.7]  ← attention weights
    |
    | weighted sum of Values
    ↓
New representation of "mat"
```

## The Full Attention Equation

For all words simultaneously, attention is computed as:

$$\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \text{softmax}\left(\frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d_k}}\right)V$$

Let's break down what's happening:

1. **$QK^T$**: Matrix multiply all queries against all keys → attention score matrix  
   (every entry is "how much token i cares about token j")

2. **$\frac{1}{\sqrt{d_k}}$**: Scale by dimension to prevent extreme values

3. **softmax**: Convert scores to probabilities (each row sums to 1)

4. **multiply by V**: Weight the values by attention scores → final output

### Diagram 3: Attention Matrix Visualization

```
     cat   sat   mat
cat [0.5   0.3   0.2]    ← attention weights for "cat"
sat [0.2   0.6   0.2]    ← attention weights for "sat"
mat [0.1   0.2   0.7]    ← attention weights for "mat"

Each row: how much this word attends to all others
```

## Why This Solves the Context Problem

Remember our "it" problem?

> "The animal didn't cross the street because **it** was too tired."

When attention processes "it":

1. Its **query** asks: "What noun am I referring to?"
2. Compares against **keys** from "animal" and "street"
3. "animal" + "tired" have high similarity → high attention score
4. Pulls in the **value** vector from "animal"
5. **Now "it" has a representation similar to "animal"!**

For the other sentence:

> "The animal didn't cross the street because **it** was too wide."

Same process, but:

- "street" + "wide" have high similarity → high attention score
- "it" pulls in the **value** vector from "street"
- **Now "it" has a representation similar to "street"!**

**The same word gets different representations based on context, all through learned matrix multiplications.**

### Diagram 4: Context-Dependent "it"

```
Sentence 1: "animal ... it ... tired"
                ↓
            it → [high attention to "animal"]
                ↓
            it ≈ animal vector

Sentence 2: "street ... it ... wide"
                ↓
            it → [high attention to "street"]
                ↓
            it ≈ street vector
```

## From One Layer to 96 Layers

ChatGPT doesn't use just one attention layer — it uses **96 layers** stacked on top of each other. Each layer refines representations in increasingly abstract ways:

**Layers 1-10: Syntax and Grammar**

- Which words are nouns, verbs, adjectives?
- Phrase boundaries and word relationships

**Layers 11-30: Semantic Relationships**

- Entity recognition (Barack Obama is a president)
- Relationships (Paris is capital of France)
- Coreference resolution

**Layers 31-60: Reasoning and Inference**

- Logical deduction (if A→B and B→C, then A→C)
- Analogical reasoning (king:queen :: man:woman)

**Layers 61-90: Task Understanding**

- What kind of question is this?
- What format should the answer take?

**Layers 91-96: Output Generation**

- Selecting specific words to generate
- Maintaining coherence

### Diagram 5: Layer Hierarchy

```
Input: "bank" (in financial context)

Layer 1:  [raw embedding]
Layer 20: [+ nearby word context]
Layer 50: [+ sentence structure]
Layer 80: [+ discourse meaning]
Layer 96: [ready for prediction]

Each layer adds more abstract understanding
```

## A Complete Transformer Block

Each layer performs multiple matrix multiplications:

```
Input Embedding
    ↓
LayerNorm
    ↓
[Attention Block]
    Q = X · W_Q
    K = X · W_K
    V = X · W_V
    Attention = softmax(QK^T/√d) · V
    Output = Attention · W_O
    ↓
Residual Add (+ Input)
    ↓
LayerNorm
    ↓
[Feed-Forward Block]
    Hidden = Output · W_1
    Hidden = GELU(Hidden)
    Final = Hidden · W_2
    ↓
Residual Add
    ↓
Next Layer
```

**Count the matmuls**: 4 in attention (Q, K, V, output) + 2 in feed-forward = **6 matmuls per layer**

For 96 layers: **576 matrix multiplications per forward pass**

### Diagram 6: One Transformer Block

```
     Input
       |
   [LayerNorm]
       |
   [Attention] ←-- 4 matmuls
       |
      (+) ←------- residual
       |
   [LayerNorm]
       |
[Feed-Forward] ←-- 2 matmuls
       |
      (+) ←------- residual
       |
     Output
```

## Following a Thought Through ChatGPT

Let's trace what happens when you ask: **"Why is the sky blue?"**

### Token → Embedding (Matmul #1)

Tokens: `["Why", "is", "the", "sky", "blue", "?"]`

Each token ID is multiplied by embedding matrix:
$$\text{Why}_0 = \text{TokenID}_{324} \cdot W_{\text{embed}}$$

### Layer 1: Basic Syntax (Matmuls #2-7)

After attention:

- "Why" recognized as question word
- "is" identified as linking verb
- "sky" and "blue" marked as key content words

### Layer 20: Semantic Understanding (Matmuls #114-119)

After many refinements:

- "sky" understood as atmosphere
- "blue" understood as color perception
- "Why" indicates causal explanation needed
- Activates concepts: light, wavelengths, scattering

### Layer 50: Knowledge Retrieval (Matmuls #294-299)

Through matrix multiplications, the model finds:
$$\text{sky} + \text{blue} + \text{why} \rightarrow \text{[high activation in "light scattering" region]}$$

The knowledge isn't looked up — **it IS the weights themselves**.

### Layer 96: Word Selection (Matmuls #570-576)

Final projection to vocabulary:
$$\text{logits} = \text{hidden}_{96} \cdot W_{\text{output}}$$

Produces probability distribution:

```
P("The") = 0.73
P("Sky") = 0.15
P("Blue") = 0.08
...
```

Picks "The", adds it to context, repeats for next word.

### Diagram 7: Information Flow Through Layers

```
"Why is the sky blue?"
        ↓
  [Embeddings]
        ↓
    [Layer 1]  ← syntax
        ↓
   [Layer 20]  ← semantics
        ↓
   [Layer 50]  ← reasoning
        ↓
   [Layer 96]  ← generation
        ↓
"The sky is blue because..."
```

## Why Matrix Multiplication Works

Matrix multiplication is the foundation because it's the most expressive linear operation that allows:

1. **Composability**: Multiple layers can be stacked to approximate complex nonlinear relationships

2. **Differentiability**: Gradients flow easily through matmuls during training, enabling backpropagation

3. **Geometric intuition**: Matmuls rotate and scale vectors in continuous space, preserving spatial relationships

4. **Expressiveness**: Can represent any linear transformation, including weighted combinations

If we used discrete operations (lookup tables, symbolic rules), gradients wouldn't propagate — the model couldn't learn through backpropagation.

---

## The Final Insight: Why Attention Creates Meaning

Attention works because **it's the mathematical operation that says "this depends on a weighted combination of those."**

And that's exactly what language understanding requires:

- **Meaning emerges from relationships**: A word's meaning comes from its relationships to other words. Matrix multiplication encodes these relationships.

- **Context determines everything**: Same word, different contexts → attention dynamically reweights representations based on surrounding words.

- **Understanding requires synthesis**: To answer "why is the sky blue?" requires combining knowledge about light, atmosphere, physics, and question-answering. Attention creates these combinations.

- **Coherence comes from consistency**: By using the same operation (matmul) throughout, the model learns consistent representations across all linguistic levels.

When you type "Why is the sky blue?", you trigger a cascade of **trillions of matrix multiplications**:

- Through 96 layers of abstraction
- With 175 billion learned weights
- Producing weighted combinations optimized over billions of training examples

Each attention operation asks: "Given this word, which other words matter?" And through learned Q, K, V matrices, it finds the answer — creating context-aware representations that capture the full richness of language.

**Attention is what makes LLMs feel "human"** — because it gives them the ability to understand that meaning doesn't live in individual words, but in the relationships between them.

> "Every attention operation is a question: 'What should I focus on?' And the answer, learned from billions of examples, is what transforms static symbols into dynamic understanding."

## Summary: The Attention Mechanism

1. **Project** each word into Q, K, V spaces (3 matmuls)
2. **Compare** queries against keys to get attention scores (1 matmul: $QK^T$)
3. **Normalize** scores with softmax (probabilities sum to 1)
4. **Combine** values using attention weights (1 matmul: $\text{scores} \cdot V$)
5. **Stack** this 96 times for hierarchical understanding

At every layer, words update their meaning based on context. By the final layer, the model has created representations that encode not just what words are, but what they _mean_ in this specific context — ready to generate coherent, contextually-appropriate responses.

**It's matrix multiplication all the way down.**
