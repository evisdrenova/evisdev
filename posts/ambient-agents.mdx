Agents are everywhere these days. It's the hot new thing yet it still feels like somethighn is missing.

The current interaction betwen agents and their environment is still very much a push. Agents are reactive in that they need to be invoked in order to do some work.

Instead they need to be proactive, liek an employee would. If you had to ask an employee to do something every time you needed something done, it would get pretty annoying pretty fast. You expect them to be able to figure it oyut themselves onvce you give them a high-level directive. Agents shoudl be the same way.
