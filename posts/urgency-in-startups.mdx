When I was a founder, there was one question that I asked myself every day. Usually multiple times a day.

"How do I create urgency for customers to buy my product?"

I would spend hours thinking about this question, trying to approach it from different angles. I would read blog posts and books and listen to podcasts with other founders trying to learn as much as I can about how they drove urgency.

But there was always one thing that bothered me.

Most companies actually don't have an urgent need to purchase most software. Unless you're a brand new company that is standing up their stack for the first time, what urgency do you have to purchase a new CRM? Or a new document management system? Or a new incident management system? Or a new payroll system?

Assuming that your current systems are already working well enough, what creates that urgency?

The reality is that there is a lot of software out there today. For every part of every stack, there are likely 3+ different vendors that sell that part. And, if we're being honest. in many cases a simple Google Sheet works well enough.

So then how do you, as a startup, drive urgency?

I've narrowed it down to 3 ways:

1. FOMO - I would argue that this is the most powerful way to drive urgency. One of the unwritten secretes of silicon valley is that every company is trying to be like 3-5 companies. If you can get those 3-5 companies to use your software, everyone else will (sometimes subconsciously) see that and think "I want to be like Stripe and if I adopt the same software as Stripe then I will be like Stripe". People will think that Stripe knows something that they don't and founders are desperate for anything that can help them. So it's not really about the software, it's really about praying on the anxiety and insecurity of founders. That might sound pathological but, hey, I never said that it wasn't.

2. Platform Shift - There is an underlying platform shift that drives boards and buyers to purchase software that they probably don't need but want. We saw this with mobile and now with AI. This is really really hard to predict but is probably the reliable way to generate urgency.

The reality is that many software companies can't drive urgency. Like I said, there is likely just no urgency to adopt a new CRM. Yet, we see plenty of commoditized software companies grow fast. How can this be?
            
1. Have a big enough top of funnel that you will inherently find buyers for your product. it's so difficult to predict timing of a platform shift or if an internal need, so if you just talk to enough people and you're generally solving a problem that some companies have then you will eventually find some customers.

## This is pretty much what most enterprise companies do. They play the long game. One to two year sales cycles.
