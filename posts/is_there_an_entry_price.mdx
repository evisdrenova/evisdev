A pattern that I've seen a few times is that a founder or founding team will workon a business and then have some sort of an exit. That first business is a "normal" tech company. Some sort of b2b saas or something that a first time founder or founding team can raise money for. once they run that business, they will go for a complete moonshot. Something highly improbable but usually fantastic. Elon did zip2 then paypal and tesla. Sam altman did loops then openai. Max Levchin did paypal then affirm. The list goes on.

The question that ive been wondering is: is there any entry cost that you have to pay in order to go after that improbable goal? Or can you just do the improbable thing?

I know people will say "yeah just go do the thing you really want to", but I think the reality is that there is an entry cost that you have to pay.

The cost is that you have to prove that you can have some level of success with an existing "easier" busisness before you go for the highly improbable thing.

I think there are two ways that we could look at this. There's reputation capital and actual capital.

Elon likely couldn't have done Tesla and/or SpaceX if he didnt have the Zip2 and Paypal proceeds to invest in those companies. Just given the nature of those companies - hardware, capital intensive, long time horizons, i think it's unlikely any investor would have given him the money he needed to give those companies a real shot if he wasn't also investing in them.

Could Sam Altman have become the president of YC and then start OpenAI if he wasn't initially a founder? Or did he have to pay that entry price in order to prove to others (Paul G et al) that he has what it takes?

IIm not necessairly saying that if you have some cfrazy big goal that you should instead go do something easier to prove that you can do it first. Im just saying that there is a pattern of people who have taken on big goals being successful by first doing soething else and gaining the reputational and sometimes actual capital to go after the big goal later.

at the same time, im not sure if those people ever actually thought of it that way? i think they just did it and then thought about what was next and decided they wanted to do sometninng really crazy.
