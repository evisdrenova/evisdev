I was recently listening to an episode of the All-in podcast where they were talking about the impact that AI will have on jobs.

Unsurprisingly, they were strongly arguing that AI will bring abundance and any job loss will be temporary and offset by economic gains. They laid out 3 main supporting arguments:

1. There is a recruiting cycle for new jobs to build the new "thing" before demand for the old thing goes away
2. AI will create new industries that we can't predict today and as a result create new jobs
3. People whos jobs are going to be impacted will have an opportunity to do more interesting work and get paid more

These are common talking points from VCs and founders in Silicon Valley and while I don't neccessairly disagree with the general idea that AI _can_ bring adundance, I do think it's worth pointing out the shaky logic that these arguments depend on.

The example they use in the podcast is how horse and buggy drivers were eventually displaced by the model T but the demand for assembly line workers gave horse and buggy drivers a new opportunity that didn't exist before. Eventually, the economic gains that resulted from the model T far outweighed the impact of lost horse and buggy workers.

This isn't really a fair comparison to the modern day job loss that will be caused by AI for a few reasons. First, the horse and buggy drivers weren't disrupted by model Ts in the same way that, for example, uber drivers will be disrupted by autonomous driving. The transportation "engine", i.e. the animal or a gas combustion engine, is just an implementation detail of how the transporation mechanism works. You still need a human operator to guide it - the horse or the car. In the past, a horse and buggy operator could become a taxi driver. An uber driver can't become a waymo driver. Autonomous driving doesn't replace the transporation engine, it replaces the operator. Therein lies the difference. When you the replace the reasoning engine of the work, you typically displace the human entirely from that workflow. It wouldn't be unreasonable to think that the models will get good enough to where you don't need to keep a human in the loop. We're already starting to see it.

The other problem is that working on an assembly line is not more interesting work than being a horse and buggy driver. In the podcast, they mention how new industries will be created to mine for rare earth metals as if working in a mine is safer and "more interesting" job than being an uber driver? An uber driver isn't an uber driver because they can't find a financial modeling job, they're uber drivers because they can't do financial modeling jobs. Taking that job away from them isn't suddenly going to cause them to start looking for financial modeling jobs.

Do I think AI will create new industries that we can't predict today? Almost certaintly. Do I think that those jobs will likely be significantly automated using AI? Absolutely.

We can see this happening already. A recent [report from the NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/21/technology/inside-amazons-plans-to-replace-workers-with-robots.html) covered how Amazon is planning on replacing 500k+ warehouse workers with AI and robotics. Where should these workers go? Using the All-in hosts' arguments, there should be a recruiting cycle for new jobs to build the new "thing" as demand for warehouse workers drops. The only new thing that I can think of is more datacenters. And I'd be willing to bet a lot of money that warehouse workers are not going to build highly complex and technical data centers.

Likely, they will try to go to another warehouse. One that hasn't been automated yet until that one eventually goes down the same path as Amazon. This job migration will continue until a majority of these jobs are automated and the only ones that aren't will be in low-wage warehouses that can't afford to automate the work.

The other example they used is that in the early 1900s, 48% of workers were farmers and in 2026 it's about 2%. The majority of those workers migrated into other parts of the economy as assembly lines, vehicles, electricity and other markets started to quckly grow. But this obviously isn't analogous to the impact of AI on jobs.

When workers migrated from farms -> factories, it was a lateral shift from doing physical labor outside to doing physical labor inside. With AI, there is no shift. No one is going from doing knowledge work in an office to suddenly doing the knowledge in a different environment. AI is fundamentally reducing the load of knowledge work not transfering it.

It might sound like I'm a doomer here but I'm really not. I believe that AI will fundamentally change our world for the better but it's irresponsible to not soberly evaluate the economic impact. And more than anything, I just don't like intellectual grifting masquerading as optimism and pro-tech accelerationism.
